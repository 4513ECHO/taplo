Most features of the Visual Studio Code extension is powered by a language server that conforms with the
[Language Server Protocol 3.16](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/).

The language server is also intended for public use for integration with other environments.

# Usage

## Native Binary

The language server is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/taplo-lsp), running `cargo install --features lsp taplo-cli` will install the server as a
`taplo` command line application, this can be used with TCP or standard i/o.

## JavaScript Package

The server is also available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@taplo/lsp), opposed to the native binary, this is only a helper library which
you can embed in your application.

It exposes an interface for the handlers it needs in order to communicate with the _outside world_, an example usage is [here](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo/blob/master/js/vscode/src/server.ts).

It also needs fetch to be available, if run inside NodeJS, `node-fetch` and some hacks are required:

```ts
import fetch, { Headers, Request, Response } from "node-fetch";

global.Headers = Headers;
global.Request = Request;
global.Response = Response;
global.Window = Object;
global.fetch = fetch;
```

In theory, the server with a subset of the features should be able to be used inside any browser with WebAssembly support, but it is untested.

# Additional Info

The server uses the `evenBetterToml` section for fetching configurations, as this is the extension's name in VSCode.

## Additional LSP Methods

Taplo also supports additional methods that are not in the official LSP specification:

```ts
/**
 * Sent from the client to the server.
 *
 * Convert a TOML text to JSON.
 */
export namespace TomlToJson {
  export interface Params {
    /**
     * TOML text
     */
    text: string;
  }

  export interface Response {
    /**
     * JSON text
     */
    text?: string;
    errors?: string[];
  }

  export const METHOD = "taplo/tomlToJson";
}

/**
 * Sent from the client to the server.
 *
 * Convert a JSON text to TOML.
 */
export namespace JsonToToml {
  export interface Params {
    /**
     * JSON text
     */
    text: string;
  }

  export interface Response {
    /**
     * TOML text
     */
    text?: string;
    error?: string;
  }

  export const METHOD = "taplo/jsonToToml";
}

/**
 * Sent from the client to the server.
 *
 * Print the syntax tree for a document for debugging.
 */
export namespace SyntaxTree {
  export interface Params {
    /**
     * URI of the TOML document,
     * it must have been opened.
     */
    uri: string;
  }

  export interface Response {
    /**
     * The syntax tree.
     */
    text: string;
  }

  export const METHOD = "taplo/syntaxTree";
}

/**
 * Sent from the server to the client.
 *
 * Used for showing a message to the user with
 * a button that navigates to the server's logs.
 */
export namespace MessageWithOutput {
  export const enum MessageKind {
    Info = "info",
    Warn = "warn",
    Error = "error",
  }

  export interface Params {
    kind: MessageKind;
    message: string;
  }

  export const METHOD = "taplo/messageWithOutput";
}

/**
 * Sent from the client to the server.
 *
 * Set the path the server should use for caching,
 * this is optional.
 */
export namespace CachePath {
  export interface Params {
    path: string;
  }

  export const METHOD = "taplo/cachePath";
}
```
