# NPM

The [default](./binary.md#default-build) build of Taplo is published to NPM as [`@taplo/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@taplo/cli). You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (tested with 16 and up) in order to use it.

## Installation via npm

```sh
npm install -g @taplo/cli
```

This will install the `taplo` executable globally.

## Installation via yarn

```sh
yarn global add @taplo/cli
```

This will also install the `taplo` executable globally.

## Run with npx

Alternatively you can run it once "without installing" via npx:

```sh
npx @taplo/cli --help
```
