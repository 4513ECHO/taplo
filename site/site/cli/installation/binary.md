# Binary Releases

We pre-compile each release for all major operating systems, these releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo/releases).

## Variations

Taplo offers features — such as the language server — that might not be useful for most use-cases. For this reason we build multiple variations that differ in terms of features.
